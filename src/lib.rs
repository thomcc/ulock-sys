//! Bindings for macOS's not-entirely-public ulock API, which provides
//! futex-like functionality.
//!
//! In general, caveat emptor. It's recommended that you read both the
//! [source][sys_ulock_c] and the [header][ulock_h]. In particular, I've not
//! documented the code very much beyond what's in the headers, aside from
//! supported version indications.
//!
//! # Support
//!
//! This API is available on darwin 16+ (macOS 10.12+, iOS 10.0+, tvOS 10.0+,
//! watchOS 3.0+, catalyst 13.0+), although some parts are darwin 19+ (macOS
//! 10.15+, iOS 13.0+, TODO: find out the rest). The parts on darwin 19+ are in
//! the `darwin19` module (it's just some additional constants, so not worth
//! feature gating).
//!
//! That is to say, this is pretty well supported, over 95% of users on both
//! macOS and iOS will have it (according to statscounter as of Jan 2021).
//!
//! That said, they're not public, and who knows the future, maybe Apple will
//! remove them. But probably not â€” they're also used by libc++, and so if they
//! ever went away, code that statically links libc++ would suddenly break,
//! but... who knows, maybe apple will do it.
//!
//! ## "weak" linking, cargo features
//!
//! As a result of that (and so that you can support older versions), if you
//! enable the `experimental-weak` feature, we'll expose a module `weak` which
//! emulates weak linking and accesses the function via `dlsym`.
//!
//! Note that on aarch64 darwin (e.g. "apple silicon", the ARM64 macbooks and
//! such) by default we don't `dlsym` even if the "experimental-weakweak"
//! feature is on unless "weak-aarch64-macos" is also specified. This is because
//! all OSes on these machines support the API. This can be overridden by
//! enabling the `weak-aarch64-macos` feature.
